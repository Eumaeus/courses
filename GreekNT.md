# Documents for the Greek New Testament Tutorial

## Major Projects (Do _one_ of the following.)

- Transcribe 2 folios of Codex Bodmer 25; identify graphemes & word-tokens.[^ws]
- Align a Chapter of Matthew across English, Latin, and Greek editions.[^ws]
- Do a Syntactic Dependency Treebank for a Biblical Chapter of Greek.[^rs]
- Translate at sight 10 verses, identifying completely every verb-form.

Pick a topic by Monday, March 17. These will be due Friday, May 2.

By Friday, March 21, give me the passage you are interested in working on, so I can prepare the data!

[^ws]: I will conduct a couple of workshops showing how this is done. This is an experiment toward future work on these texts.

[^rs]: It might make sense for a pair of collaborators to join forces and do a syntactic treebank and an alignment.

## Reading Schedule

- We will read through _Genesis_ 10.29 (the end of Noah's story).
- We will read _Exodus_ 20-21 (the first part of the Law).
- We will read 1 Corinthians 12-13 (Paul on gifts, variety, and love).

## Final Exam

- I will give you a selection of passages, each of approx. 5 verses, to prepare.
- You will be asked to translate one of them.
- You will also be given another passage to translate, approx. 3 verses. This will be from what we have read.
- You will be given a third passage, from something we haven't read. 

**N.b.** The standards for evaluating these three will of course be different. 

## Who is Doing What?

## Notes on alignment

- We have citations down to the word level.
- Get a setence treebanked.
- Generate and index…

    - Sentence-URNs.
    - Syntax-Token-URNs. This must include ellipsis as a citeable node.

- We generate an index… syntax-token --> translation-word-token(s).
