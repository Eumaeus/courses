# Documents for the Greek New Testament Tutorial

## Major Projects (Due 

- Transcribe 2 folios of Codex Bodmer 25; identify graphemes & word-tokens.[^ws]
- Align a Chapter of Matthew across English, Latin, and Greek editions.[^ws]
- Translate at sight 10 verses, identifying completely every verb-form.

[^ws]: I will conduct a couple of workshops showing how this is done. This is an experiment toward future work on these texts.

## Final Exam

- I will give you a selection of passages, each of approx. 5 verses, to prepare.
- You will be asked to translate one of them.
- You will also be given another passage to translate, approx. 3 verses. This will be from what we have read.
- You will be given a third passage, from something we haven't read. 

**N.b.** The standards for evaluating these three will of course be different.
