## What the Alignment Should Look Like

> Plain text; two columns; separated by a tab-character. It is easiest to start simply with citations, which we can expand to full URNs programmatically later.

The following chart includes a third column for information; your work should be only two columns: a URN to a Greek token or range of Greek tokens, a tab-character, and a URN to an English token or range of English tokens.

| Column 1 (Greek citations) | Column 2 (English citations) | Alignment |
|---|---|---|
| 6.9.1 | 6.9.1-6.9.3 | Οὕτως =  after this manner |
| 6.9.2 | 6.9.4 | οὖν = therefore |
6.9.3 | 6.9.5 | προσεύχεσθε = pray |
6.9.4 | 6.9.6 | ὑμεῖς = ye |
6.9.6 | 6.9.7 | Πάτερ = father |
6.9.7 | 6.9.6 | ἡμῶν = our |
6.9.8 | 6.9.10-6.9.11 | ὁ = which art |
6.9.9 | 6.9.12 | ἐν = in |
6.9.10-6.9.11 | 6.9.13 | τοῖς οὐρανοῖς = heaven |
6.9.13 | 6.9.15-6.9.16 | ἁγιασθήτω = hallowed be |
6.9.14-6.9.15 | 6.9.18 | τὸ ὄνομά = name |
6.9.16 | 6.9.17 | σου = thy |

## Notes

- When tokens are contiguous, use ranges, e.g. `6.9.1-6.9.3`.
- When tokens are non-contiguous, make multiple rows in the table.
- **Ellipsis**. For now, this will mostly be a linking-verb elided in the Greek. E.g. "…which [art] in heaven." For now, let's align that with the expresses grammatical subject.

	- πάτερ ἡμῶν ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς  
	- πάτερ = Father
	- ἡμῶν = our
	- ὁ = which art
	- ἐν = in	
	- τοῖς οὐρανοῖς = heaven

- Ignore punctuation.
- For now, align the Greek with the KJV. If you get fired up, you can have a go at the Vulgate Latin, but I have no idea how time-consuming this process will be, so that may be impractical now.

## Links and URNs

The page for looking up passage of text is:

[http://folio.furman.edu/citeservlet/svcforms]()

> Use the search box under "Examples: see details…" and "a text:". Use the URN for your text, followed by a colon, then a period-delimited citation. E.g. `urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg001.fu01t:1.1-1.10`.

URNs for tokenized texts are as follows:

- Genesis

	- Greek: `urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg001.fu01t`
	- KJV: `urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0527.tlg001.fuKJVt`

## Final Note

As ever, we are building the ship as we sail it. With these additions, the database that defines these texts now contains over 12,000,000 records. It may not be responsive (this is unexplored country). It is also entirely possible that I have messed up the encoding of these texts in some way. If the server does not seem to be working, or if you ask for Romans and get Psalms, please let me know!
